```
In some cases above commands doesn't work, Then use following command.

```
# /usr/pgsql-9.3/bin/postgresql93-setup initdb
```

Above command will take some time to initialize PostgreSQL first time. PGDATA environment variable contains path of data directory.

PostgreSQL data directory Path: /var/lib/pgsql/9.3/data/


Start PostgreSQL service using following command.

```
# service postgresql-9.3 start

```
Setup PostgreSQL service to auto start on system boot.

```
# chkconfig postgresql-9.3 on

```
Verify PostgreSQL Installation

After completing, we have installed postgres 9.3 on server, Let do a basic test to verify that installation completed successfully. To verify switch to postgres user.

```
# su - postgres
```

```
$ psql

psql (9.3.1)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```
Congratulationâ€™s! You have successfully installed PostgreSQL Server.
